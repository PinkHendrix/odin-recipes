Project: Recipes

We were to choose any foods that we like and build a page for each following certain requirements.

We started with a basic Pan Pizza recipe and added to it an Image, a list of Ingredients (unordered list) and Steps (ordered list) to build it.

Afterwards we built 2 more similar recipe pages, one for an Arepa and one for a Carne Mechada dish.  Coincidentally, both are Venezuelan dishes...

We added Images, Ingredients and Steps to both just like in the first Pizza page per the project's instructions to maintain an "identical page structure."

Hope you enjoy and actually give those dishes a try, cheers!
